## Project Title - QuizWorld

My motivation for creating this project is a result of the current situation in the country because of the Covid virus. All training in the country went online. So the idea is to create a quiz type questionnaire that other users can answer.
The project is a web application in which people register so they can create a quiz with questions. Anyone authorized in the application can answer the appropriate test and see their result.

### Features

*	User registration and login in the application
* Create, edit and delete a test
*	View the list of all tests with pagination, sort and search functionality (users see only public and own tests, but admin see all)
* Join to test with join code (unique)
*	Add, edit and delete questions and possible answers
*	Add and remove participants to test (used for private tests)
*	View the list of all participants to related test with pagination and search functionality
*	View the result of the test after solving
*	Delete result to related test(only test owner can do this and admin)
*	View the list of all results to related test with pagination and search functionality
*	Search and view personal results in separate page
*	View the list of all users with pagination, sort and search functionality
*	View statistic for every test - total questions, participants, results
*	Edit test description and question with rich text editor
*	Functionality for locking and unlocking users by an administrator - IN FUTURE
*	Accumulation of points - IN FUTURE
